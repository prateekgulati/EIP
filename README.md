# EIP: External Internship Program 
### Session 5: Grad-CAM Gallery
Implementation of [Grad-CAM](http://gradcam.cloudcv.org/), Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping and build a gallery to visualize the important regions of an image during prediction. 

### Session 6: Text Generation with LSTM
Implementation of [Text Generation With LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks](https://machinelearningmastery.com/text-generation-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) with additional optimization for improved results.
Training an LSTM model from scratch that uses a seed sentence as input and predicts the next few sentences. 

### Session 7: Cycle-GAN to alter facial features
Implementation of cycle-gan in Keras to change race, age, and gender of a face.
