## Session 5: Grad-CAM Gallery
This section includes implementation of [Grad-CAM](http://gradcam.cloudcv.org/), Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, and build a gallery to visualize the important regions in an image during predictions. 

### Details:
**Architecture**: [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) (built and trained from scratch)  
**Dataset**: [Tiny-Imagenet](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip)  
**Validation Accuracy**: 63%  

### Results:
